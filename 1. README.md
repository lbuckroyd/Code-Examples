Here are some examples of R code that I've written. Unfortunately, it's been very difficult to find a coding example from the last year that I would be able to share with you - the only example I settled on was very short. So I've backed this up with two more examples (both included on my CV) that evidence me using R to model and manipulate political data.

### Transforming Data ###
This is the only example from my current role - it's a personal project that I developed after encountering a problem at work. Data had been provided to us as a .csv file, but needed to be manually converted to a .sav file before we could analyse it in our usual software (Q). The main problem was converting questions that had been saved as textual data into separate dummy variables, so once we had found a solution, I decided to write a piece of code that would've done the same job.


### National Identity x General Election ###
This is the coding file from my dissertation, submitted May 2023. I explored whether the act of voting in a general election could change your sense of nationhood - i.e. whether having your preferred party win the general election would make you feel more British - and then, whether winning or losing at a constituency level has any impact on this. I applied linear regressions to data from the British Election Study to find my results, and finished the project by predicting the effect that each scenario has on your personal sense of national identity.


### Identifying Twitter Hate Speech ###
This project is work from my time as a Research Assistant, and is the project I explained in my interview (albeit not very well!). I was involved in the early stages of a cross-discipline research project trying to build a machine-learning model that could automatically and accurately identify hate speech. My responsibility was to compare two versions of language processing models - a dictionary model and a bayes classifier - and look at the accuracy and interesting findings from each. The data used here is Tweet data sourced from Twitter, and saved as a .csv file. As a warning on this project - the code contains a list of hate speech profanities at one point, where I import a dictionary into the model. I decided the code would not make as much sense if I removed these, but be aware of this before you decide to open the file!

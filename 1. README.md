## Hi there!
Here are some examples of R code that I've written. Unfortunately, it's been very difficult to find a coding example from the last year that I would be able to share with you - the only example I settled on was very short. So I've backed this up with two more examples (both included on my CV) that evidence me using R to model and manipulate political data.

### Transforming Data ###
This is the only example from my current role - it's a personal project that I developed after encountering a problem at work. Data had been provided to us as a .csv file, but needed to be manually converted to a .sav file before we could analyse it in our usual software (Q). The main problem was converting questions that had been saved as textual data into separate dummy variables, so once we had found a solution, I decided to write a piece of code that would've done the same job.

### National Identity x General Election ###
This is the coding file from my dissertation, submitted May 2023. I explored whether the act of voting in a general election could change your sense of nationhood - i.e. whether having your preferred party win the general election would make you feel more British - and then, whether winning or losing at a constituency level has any impact on this. I applied linear regressions to data from the British Election Study to find my results, and finished the project by predicting the effect that each scenario has on your personal sense of national identity.
